# 🔴 Red Bull x Claremont Colleges  
### A Micro Market & Shopper Insights Study Across the 5C Campuses

## 🎯 Core Question
How do consumption habits, preferences, and brand perceptions differ across the 5C campuses, and what opportunities exist to improve Red Bull’s presence and positioning on each?

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

A fun creative micro-study inspired by my interest in Red Bull’s **Insights & Analytics Graduate** program. My goal was to simulate the type of shopper insights work Red Bull does across On Premise accounts—except at a hyper-local level within the Claremont Colleges (Pomona, Pitzer, Scripps, CMC, and Harvey Mudd).

I designed and distributed a fun, occasion-based survey paired with free Red Bull samples to better understand:

- **Consumption occasions** (e.g., studying, partying, working out)  
- **Path to purchase** (where students typically buy Red Bull on or off campus)  
- **Price perception and promo interest**  
- **Brand image** across different campuses  
- **Campus-specific execution suggestions** (cooler placement, events, promotions)

Although the sample size was modest (44 responses), the process was fun and reflective of the creative and analytical thinking I would bring to Red Bull’s Insights team. I even made this life size Red Bull can!

## 📝 Survey Design

Survey was optimized to map to common Red Bull analytics dimensions, like **On Premise Occasion Mapping**, **Price Communication**, and **Execution Insights**.

### Key Questions:
- **What school do you go to?**  
  → Enables segmentation across the 5Cs.

- **When do you usually drink energy drinks?**  
  → Maps to consumption occasions:
    - 🧠 Studying or late-night work  
    - 🏋️‍♀️ Pre-workout  
    - 🎉 Parties/social events  
    - 😴 Hangovers/tiredness  
    - 🚫 I don’t drink energy drinks  

- **Where would you go to get an energy drink on campus?**  
  → Reveals preferred purchase paths:
    - 🧊 Vending machines  
    - 🛒 Campus stores (The Hub, The Coop, etc.)  
    - 📦 Off-campus or delivery  
    - 🤷‍♂️ Not sure where to go  

- **What would make you more likely to buy Red Bull?**  
  → Hits on execution and promo levers:
    - 💸 Lower price / student discount  
    - 🎁 Bundles or giveaways  
    - 😋 More flavor options  
    - 🐂 More campus events / presence  
    - 🧊 Better cooler placement  
    - 🚫 Wouldn’t buy regardless  

- **If Red Bull was a person on campus, what kind of vibe would they have?** *(optional)*  
  → Fun brand perception check — free response + optional AI image output.

## 🔍 Learnings

- Students are highly occasion-driven (studying and pre-workout were top drivers).
- Many students didn’t know where Red Bull was sold on campus — **distribution visibility is low.**
- Flavor variety and price were the most requested improvements.
- Brand perception varies by campus — Pitzer and Scripps respondents associated Red Bull with a more niche/functional vibe, while CMC students leaned into party energy.

- Explore the kind of questions and methods used in **shopper and occasion-based insights**
- Simulate a small-scale version of **On Premise segmentation work**
- Express genuine interest in Red Bull’s **Insights & Analytics Graduate Program**
